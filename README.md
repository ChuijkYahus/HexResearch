# Hex Research

An addon to Hex Casting that provides alternative ways to accomplish Hexcasting progression.

The general philosophy is that there should be a tedious, but benign way to accomplish any given goal, as well as a faster route, if one is willing to abuse friendly NPCs.

## New Spell

### Thought Sieve

Learns the correct stroke order of a Great Spell by filtering possibilities through the mind of a villager. May have adverse effects on the villager.

## Future Plans
 * A way to learn great spells without abusing Villagers
   * Maybe. The loot dive makes a good tedious alternative, which makes the villager abuse method more attractive.
 * A way to create blocks that normally require Mind Flay
   * Some sort of artificial mind that's trained via proximity to high ranking villagers
   * Integration with HexGloop's mind jar, allowing a jar to be filled via this mechanic
 * Automatons
   * A specicalized artifical mind that may be encoded with a hex, not unlike a wisp
   * Can be loaded into a flayed villager or an artifical construct not unlike a golem
